This repository contains the exercises done in the Data Analytics bootcamp, in the pair programming mode, solved by the students Marina Ferreras and Natalia GarcÃ­a. 
In this module we have learned basic notions about Machine Learning, specifically about supervised learning models: Linear Regressions and Logistic Regressions. This is how the repository is organized, in two folders. Here the libraries ðŸ“– that we have used:

    - SickitLearn 
    
    - Scipy
    
    - Imblearn
    
    - Researchpy
    
    - Pandas
    
    - Matplotlib 
    
    - Seaborn
    
    - Numpy
